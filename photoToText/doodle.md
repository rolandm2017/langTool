so

google cloud vision works well, but not perfectly.

1. import-ant is split across two lines. fine.
2. some jibberish comes back sometimes

hence, the py server will submit the words, and the java server will ask, "are these all valid french words?"
the invalid Fr words will uh, be discarded.

Hence I need a Fr dictionary db.
